=====================

 

### With this repo we will;

 

-   Use Infrastructure as Code (terraform), and CI/CD (AWS CodePipeline) to
    launch EKS/Fargate container infrastructure on AWS.

 

-   Deploy a simple containerized application (based on deploying micro services
    to EKS Fargate
    [https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/180_fargate/](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/180_fargate/)).

 

-   Integrate the Anchore open-source tool for deep analysis of the docker
    images.
